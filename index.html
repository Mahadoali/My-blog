            <h1 class="site-title">Beyond the Cage</h1>
            <p class="site-subtitle"> I chose this title because 'The Cage' powerfully represents the restrictive and oppressive system of apartheid that defined Trevor's early life and significantly impacted his mother's experiences, including her later marriage to his stepfather. For his mother, a Black woman, the 'cage' dictated her freedoms and opportunities. While his stepfather came into the picture later, the environment of apartheid and its remaining effects still shaped their family life and presented its own set of challenges. 'Beyond' then signifies their individual and collective efforts to navigate and, in their own ways, transcend these constraints. It speaks to his mother's resilience in building a life for herself and Trevor, and Trevor's journey of finding his identity and voice in a world shaped by the remnants of that 'cage,' including his relationship with his stepfather. Ultimately, the title reflects the desire to live and thrive beyond the limitations imposed by a system of racial segregation.

                    <p>The quote, 'He only wants a woman who is free because his dream is to put her in a cage', hits at the heart of many modern conversations around gender <br> roles and Relationships. it's about Control disguised as admiration. Abel admired Patrici's strength, idependence and spirit but instead of supporting it , he saw it as something to conquuer. <br>This reflects a toxic ideal many still hold, valuing empowered women but feeling threatend by them</p>


                    <p>In today's world, we often hear phrases like "strong women  intimidate weak men ", and this is exactly what the quote captures. <br> too many Relationships are based not on partnership , but on power. A man may claim <br>he wants a confident, independent partner, yet when that confidence challenges his authority, insecurity turns into resentment.</p>
                    <p>We see this in real life when women are told they're "too much or too opinionated", espacially in cultures where gender roles remain rigid. <br> Even in progressive societies emotional manipulation, jealousy, or attempts to tame strong personalities still exit.</p>
                    <p>Partricia resisted the cage. She stayed true to herself, and that defiance both empowered Trevor and threatend Abel. The story warns us <br> to be wary of people who admire freedom only when its under their Control.</p>

                    <h3>Personal Reflection</h3>
                    <p>I have seen friends in Relationships where they dimmed their light to make someone else fell secure. This quote remainds me that real love <br> doesn't shrink or cage , it supports and celebrates.</p>
